## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to round a number to show only 2 digits with the fixed method.
- Tried to structure my code in a way that the functions only made one thing. That made them easier to debug and maintain.

### Continued development

I will continue to research about best practices and clean code.
